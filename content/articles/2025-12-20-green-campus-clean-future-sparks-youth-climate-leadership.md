The "Green Campus, Clean Future" event was organized by the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies (IDMVS), University of Dhaka, and supported by VSO Bangladesh and successfully implemented by YCI Bangladesh. It was engaged over 150 students of G.R. Institution, Sonargaon, Narayanganj, on Sunday, July 27, 2025. The program commenced with a Plastic Exchange Program, where students traded unused plastic items, such as bags, bottles, and broken rulers, for eco-friendly gifts like pads and pens embedded with vegetable seeds. This initiative aimed to raise awareness about plastic pollution and encourage environmentally-friendly habits.

A comprehensive Climate Awareness Seminar followed, featuring key speakers including Upazila Education Officers Delowar Hossain and Kajal Chandra Paul, alongside IDMVS Lecturers Raisa Imran Chowdhury and Jawad Ibn Farid. Ms. Raisa Imran emphasized the critical role of youth, stating, "If students become aware, it is possible to build a climate-resilient Bangladesh in the future". The engagement of headteachers from nearby institutions strengthened environmental advocacy across the area.

The event concluded with an engaging student debate on the topic, "Government initiatives alone are sufficient to prevent environmental pollution," fostering critical thinking and leadership skills. Through these interactive sessions, the program effectively fostered sustainable practices among students, reminding all attendees that meaningful change begins with awareness, and that the youth are essential to leading the way toward a climate-resilient Bangladesh.
