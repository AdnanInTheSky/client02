### **Plot Summary**

The film follows **Rizwan Khan** (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with **Asperger’s syndrome**, who moves to the U.S. to live with his brother. There, he meets **Mandira** (Kajol), a Hindu single mother, and the two fall in love and marry.

However, after the **9/11 attacks**, their lives are turned upside down. Rizwan faces discrimination and tragedy, which sends him on a journey across America to deliver a message to the U.S. President:

> “My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.”

### **Performances**

*   **Shah Rukh Khan** delivers one of his most powerful, restrained performances — far from his usual romantic hero persona.
    
*   **Kajol** brings emotional depth and strength to Mandira, grounding the film in raw emotion.
    
*   Their chemistry remains as magnetic as in their earlier films (_Kuch Kuch Hota Hai_, _Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham_).

### **Direction & Cinematography**

Karan Johar steps away from his usual glossy family dramas and presents a socially conscious, emotional story. The film blends **Hollywood-style realism** with **Bollywood heart** — scenic American landscapes meet deeply emotional Indian storytelling.

### **Music**

Composed by **Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy**, the soundtrack is soulful and uplifting — especially “Noor-e-Khuda” and “Tere Naina.” The score perfectly complements the film’s emotional tone.

### **Criticisms**

*   The second half occasionally drifts into melodrama.
    
*   Some found the “meet the President” quest unrealistic, though symbolically it works.

### **Verdict**

⭐ **Rating:** 8.5/10

A moving, thought-provoking film that combines emotional storytelling with a strong social message. _My Name Is Khan_ remains one of Bollywood’s most heartfelt attempts to bridge faith, identity, and humanity — anchored by one of Shah Rukh Khan’s career-best performances.
