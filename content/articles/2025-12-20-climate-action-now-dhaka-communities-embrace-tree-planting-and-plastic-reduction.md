The 2nd addition of "Green Roots: Community Climate Action" event was held on Thursday, June 26, 2025, at the Jaago Foundation School in Rayer Bazar, Dhaka. It was supported by VSO Bangladesh and organized by the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies (IDMVS), in association with YCI Bangladesh. The formal segment began with a Tree Exchange Program, where each participant exchanged a discarded plastic item from home for a plant sapling. The distributed saplings were native varieties such as mango, jackfruit, guava, lemon, and black plum (jam), along with flowering and beneficial plants like the neem tree. The primary goal was to highlight the value of tree plantation while simultaneously discouraging the use of plastic materials.

The event successfully engaged with over 40 families to raise awareness about climate change impacts. It promoted alternatives to plastic use, encouraged sustainable recycling habits, and inspired active community participation in tree plantation efforts. The initiative also gathered valuable feedback on climate-related challenges and strengthened connections between youth volunteers and local residents. Overall, the "Green Roots" event effectively raised awareness and promoted practical actions like recycling and tree plantation. Organizing similar programs in other vulnerable urban communities is strongly encouraged to strengthen climate resilience and foster environmentally responsible behavior.
