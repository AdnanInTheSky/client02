The prize-giving ceremony of the “Green Eid, Green Generation: Invest for a Better Future” initiative was held on 16 July at the head office of Ajker Patrika. The event was funded and supported by YCI Bangladesh, with implementation support from Pathokbondhu.

This unique environmental initiative encouraged participants to celebrate Eid in a meaningful and sustainable way. Those who travelled to their hometowns during Eid took part in the campaign by planting a tree in their local community. The objective was to promote environmental responsibility, inspire youth engagement, and create a collective impact across different parts of the country.

After returning to Dhaka, all participating students and youth were awarded in recognition of their contribution to the environment. The ceremony highlighted their commitment to creating a greener and more climate-resilient Bangladesh. Speakers at the event appreciated the participants’ enthusiasm and emphasized the importance of youth-led initiatives in combating climate challenges.

The organizers also expressed gratitude to YCI Bangladesh for funding the program and to Pathokbondhu for their collaborative support. They noted that such activities not only foster environmental awareness but also build a culture of responsible citizenship among the younger generation.
